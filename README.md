# Spotify-Music-Data-Analysis-and-Track-Popualrity-Classification
Our project is about performing Exploratory Data Analysis on a Spotify music dataset which comprises of songs streamed from year 2010 through 2019. As Spotify offers one of the largest music streaming service to the users on a global scale, it is evident that understanding different styles of music is an essential step for deriving insights. For the project, we have explored the data to the extent where we could figure out the key elements that influence track popularity.
